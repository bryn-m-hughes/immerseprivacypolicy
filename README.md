# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: Feb. 18th 2025_

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and disclose information when you use the Immerse BETA Chrome extension ("extension" or "Extension"). By using the extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information I Collect
- **Word Click Data:** I track which words are clicked for a hint and the timestamp of each click.
- **Translation Data:** I track which words are translated and the timestamp of each translation. The translation data is stored in its translated form (not in English) and is unordered and uncontextualized.
- **Screen Text for Translation:** The text displayed on your screen is sent to the translation server solely for processing translations. This text is not stored beyond generating the translation.
- **Authentication Data:** I record only an anonymous Supabase sign-in to manage authentication.

No other usage data is recorded.

## How I Use the Information
- **Enhancing the Extension:** To analyze usage, improve functionality, and tailor the translation and language learning features.
- **User Experience:** To personalize and optimize your interaction with the extension.
- **Support and Communication:** To address inquiries, provide customer support, and send relevant updates.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure
- **Service Providers:** I share data with trusted third-party service providers (such as Supabase) that assist in storing and processing your information.
- **Legal Requirements:** I may disclose your information if required by law, regulation, or legal process.
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred as part of the transaction.

## Data Security Practices
I implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

## Data Retention
I retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

## Your Rights
- **Access and Update:** You may request access to or updates of your personal data.
- **Deletion:** You can request that your data be deleted, subject to applicable legal or contractual restrictions.
- **Opt-Out:** Where applicable, you may opt out of certain data collection practices.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated effective date.
